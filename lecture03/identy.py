# Example of the identity operator
# Two variables pointing to the same list object
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
# Two variables pointing to different list objects with the same content

c = [1, 2, 3]
d = [1, 2, 3]
# Using the identity operator
print (a is b)
# True, since a and b refer to the same object
print (a is c) # False, since a and c refer to different objects 
print (c is d) # False, since c and d refer to different objects
# Using the equality operator for comparison
print (a==c) # True, since the contents of a and c are equal 
print (c==d) # True, since the contents of c and d are equal
